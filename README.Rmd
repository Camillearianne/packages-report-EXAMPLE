# packages-report

## Overview

The goal of packages-report is to explore the packages in my R installation.

```{r, include = FALSE}
freqtable_file <- fs::dir_ls(here::here("data"), glob = "*freqtable.csv")
apt_freqtable <- readr::read_csv(freqtable_file)
```

I have `r sum(apt_freqtable$n)` add-on packages installed.

Here's how they break down in terms of which version of R they were built under, which is related to how recently they were updated on CRAN.

### How analysis was done

[R/01_write-installed-packages.R](R/01_write-installed-packages.R) writes installed packages to file [data/installed_packages.csv](data/installed_packages.csv).

[R/02_wrangle-packages.R](R/02_wrangle-packages.R) retains only add-on packages and the variables `Package` and `Built`. Creates frequency table. Writes to [data/add-on-packages.csv](data/add-on-packages.csv) and [data/add-on-packages-freqtable.csv](data/add-on-packages-freqtable.csv).

[R/03_built-barchart.R](R/03_built-barchart.R) creates a barchart [figs/built-barchart.png](figs/built-barchart.png) from the frequency table.
